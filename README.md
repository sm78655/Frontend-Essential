AI Chatbot:

The chatbot is integrated using the OpenAI API and is designed to answer general questions about the service, products, and sustainability practices.

The chatbot runs locally for demonstration purposes only.

Important:

The API key is not committed to GitHub.

Users are advised not to share personal or sensitive information.

Accessibility:

The website includes basic accessibility features such as:

Semantic HTML elements

Skip-to-content link

Proper form labels

Keyboard navigation support

Responsive layout for different screen sizes

Ethical Considerations

The AI chatbot provides informational responses only.

User privacy is respected, and sensitive data is not collected.

The OpenAI API key is kept private and excluded from version control.

Limitations of AI responses are acknowledged.

Future Improvements

Backend integration for real product ordering and user accounts

Secure server-side handling of API keys

Improved chatbot memory and contextual responses

Additional accessibility testing with screen readers

Online deployment with performance optimization
